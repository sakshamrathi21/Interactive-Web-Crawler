                Hi peeps, Parinay Dewangan this side. Do come to my cake murder on 5th of April. Well, I am originally from Bhilai, Chhattisgarh, but I can change my address to your heart if you like (meant only for girls, HAHA!). Currently going through my second year in the department of Electrical Engineering, pursuing a B.Tech degree (obviously) i.e two more years for fun only.
