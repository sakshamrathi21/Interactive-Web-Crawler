        A recursive web crawler is a program or script designed to navigate through the web by following links from one webpage to another. The term "recursive" implies that the crawler explores the web in a recursive manner, meaning it repeatedly performs the same set of actions at each level of exploration.

Here's a basic overview of how a recursive web crawler works:
<br>
<br>
1. Start URL: The crawler begins with an initial URL, usually referred to as the seed URL. This is the starting point for the crawling process.
<br>
2. Fetch Page: The crawler retrieves the content of the webpage associated with the current URL. This can include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources.
<br>
3. Parse Content: The crawler parses the content of the webpage to extract relevant information, such as links to other pages.
<br>
4. Queue URLs: The crawler adds the newly discovered URLs to a queue or a list of URLs to be processed.
<br>
5. Repeat: The crawler continues this process iteratively by fetching each URL from the queue, parsing its content, extracting new URLs, and adding them to the queue. This recursive process continues until a predefined stopping condition is met, such as a maximum depth or a limit on the number of pages to be crawled.
<br>
<br>
Recursive crawling is essential for systematically exploring the vast interconnected network of web pages. It allows the crawler to discover new pages by following links and, in turn, discovering even more links on those pages. This method helps build a comprehensive map of the web.
<br>
It's worth noting that web crawlers are used by search engines to index the content of websites, enabling users to search and find relevant information on the internet. Additionally, web crawlers are employed for various purposes, such as data mining, content scraping, and website analysis.
